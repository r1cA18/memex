- Yesterday's incomplete tasks carried over
- Tasks displayed by timeslot

## During Work

### Quick Capture

Dump thoughts to Inbox without processing:

```
> Add to inbox: Research caching strategies
```

Creates `Tasks/Inbox/research-caching.md` with minimal metadata.

### Activity Logging

Add entries to daily page:

```
> Log: 10:30 Started API design meeting
```

Appends to today's Log section.

## Break Time

### Inbox Processing

```
> Organize inbox
```

For each item:
1. Clarify: What is this? Is it actionable?
2. Metadata: Add priority, timeslot, project
3. Decide: Active, Someday, or Trash

## Task Completion

```
> Mark task-api-design as done
```

- Status updated to `done`
- Moved to `Tasks/Done/`
- Prompt: Extract knowledge?
